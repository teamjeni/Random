<strong>The focus of this ring is a vibrant natural Paradise Turquoise cabochon that is rich cyan and small hints of deep emerald green around small patches of tan to light brown matrix. The band is hand-forged and has been peened to give a soft dimpled pattern. The metal is gleaming sterling and fine (bezel) silver, which sets off the colors in the stone magnificently.</strong>
